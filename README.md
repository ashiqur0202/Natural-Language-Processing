<h1>Natural Language Processing </h1>

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that focuses on the interactions between computers and humans using natural language. NLP aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language, both written and spoken, to perform tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and text summarization. It involves a range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and statistical methods. NLP has a wide range of applications, including chatbots, voice assistants, and text analysis for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and content classification.


<h1>Step 1: Install and import NLTK</h1>

<h1>Step 2: Load data</h1>

<h1>Step 3: Text preprocessing - tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming</h1>

<h1>Step 4: Feature extraction</h1>

<h1>Step 5: Model Building: common models used in NLP include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h1>

<h1>Step 6: Evaluate the performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score</h1>

<h1>Step 7: Deploy the model to make predictions on new text data </h1>
